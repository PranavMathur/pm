Personal Python utility functions module

This module contains utility functions I've written over the past few years. `__init__.py` contains an assortment of helpful functions and classes.
`files.py` contains convenience methods for reading/writing to files - plaintext, JSON, or pickle.
`logging.py` contains my implementation of a simple logger.
`strings.py` contains useful functions for dealing with strings and regular expressions.

To use this module, place the folder in the `site-packages` folder of your Python installation. This can be found by printing `sys.path` in Python.
